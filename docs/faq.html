        <h1>RTNC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
        <p>Neutral, plain-language answers about how RTNC is structured and how the protocol behaves.</p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What is RTNC in simple terms?</h2>
        <p>
          RTNC is a proof-of-work blockchain protocol. It records transactions, follows fixed rules, and operates without
          privileged participants. People may choose to run software that interacts with the protocol, but RTNC itself is not a
          financial product and does not provide financial features.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Is RTNC an investment?</h2>
        <p>
          No. RTNC is not designed or presented as an investment. It does not offer returns, income, or financial performance.
          Any external activity surrounding digital assets is separate from the protocol and outside its scope.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. What makes RTNC different from many blockchains?</h2>
        <p>RTNC avoids several common design patterns often associated with complex token systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No premine or privileged allocations.</li>
          <li>No token sale or fundraising mechanisms.</li>
          <li>No staking, yield systems, or reward programs.</li>
          <li>No protocol-level features tied to financial expectations.</li>
          <li>No governance authority over supply or tokenomics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RTNC’s focus is transparency, predictable rules, and long-term operational clarity.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Who controls RTNC?</h2>
        <p>
          No single party controls the protocol. Its rules are encoded in open-source software, and users independently choose
          whether to run compatible implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The RTNC Foundation, a non-profit organization, may support documentation, infrastructure, and research. However, it
          cannot change protocol-level economics or alter user balances.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. How do transactions work?</h2>
        <p>
          RTNC follows a UTXO-style transaction model similar to other proof-of-work systems. A user’s wallet constructs a
          transaction, signs it with the appropriate keys, and broadcasts it to the network. Miners include valid transactions
          in blocks. Once confirmed, transactions become part of the protocol’s permanent history.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. How do people obtain RTNC units?</h2>
        <p>
          RTNC units enter the system only through block creation, according to the emission schedule defined by the protocol.
          People may transfer units to one another through standard transaction behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          RTNC does not operate a marketplace, endorse third-party platforms, or provide guidance on external exchanges. Any
          interactions outside the protocol occur at the discretion of independent parties and are not part of RTNC’s design.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Can mining provide financial outcomes?</h2>
        <p>
          Mining is a technical activity that consumes electricity and hardware resources. The protocol does not describe mining
          as a financial activity and does not make statements regarding external market behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone exploring mining should evaluate it purely as a technical operation and begin with non-production networks
          (Testnet or Regtest) to avoid unintended transactions or misuse.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Does RTNC have staking or yield features?</h2>
        <p>
          No. RTNC does not include staking, yield generation, or mechanisms that create or imply passive income. The protocol
          contains only block rewards and transaction fees as part of its technical operation, not as financial incentives.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Is there a developer allocation or automatic deduction?</h2>
        <p>
          No. RTNC does not include protocol-level deductions, embedded redistributions, or automatic allocations to any party.
          All emission follows a fixed schedule defined in the protocol rules.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>10. Where should someone new begin?</h2>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with blockchain software:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with the RTNC Whitepaper for a conceptual overview.</li>
          <li>Review the Architecture and Developer Overview pages for structure and components.</li>
          <li>
            Use Testnet or Regtest environments for any hands-on learning before interacting with full nodes or mainnet
            behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Interacting with the protocol does not require technical expertise, but learning in a controlled environment is
          recommended.
