<h1>RTNC Mining Paper v1.0</h1>
<p>Proof-of-work mining model, emission behavior, and phased hardware progression for RTNC.</p>
</header>
<section>
<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
          Mining is the process that secures the RTNC network, validates transactions, and introduces new RTNC into
          circulation. Miners perform proof-of-work computations to build blocks, and in return they receive block
          rewards and transaction fees. There are no staking rewards, no protocol-managed yield, and no embedded
          financial schemes within mining.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>2. Mining Philosophy</h2>
<p>
          RTNC mining is built around three principles: fairness, predictability, and long-term security. The protocol
          is designed so that early participation is not restricted to wealthy or industrial players, and long-term
          security is achieved without sacrificing legal simplicity.
        </p>
<h3>2.1 Fairness First</h3>
<p>
          Mining begins in a CPU-friendly phase to give more people a realistic chance to participate using existing
          hardware. There is no private mining window and no hidden testnet-to-mainnet advantage.
        </p>
<h3>2.2 Predictability</h3>
<p>
          The emission curve, block timing, and difficulty adjustment rules are defined in advance and not subject to
          governance intervention. This prevents arbitrary changes that could advantage a subset of miners.
        </p>
<h3>2.3 Security Through Progression</h3>
<p>
          Over time, RTNC anticipates a natural evolution from CPU miners to GPU miners and eventually ASIC miners.
          Rather than fight this progression, the protocol is designed to handle it cleanly, preserving security while
          keeping the rules stable.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>3. Consensus and Block Production</h2>
<p>
          RTNC uses proof-of-work with a ten-minute target block time. Each block contains a set of validated
          transactions and a coinbase transaction that pays the mining reward to the block creator.
        </p>
<p>
          Nodes verify blocks by checking the proof-of-work, ensuring that all transactions are valid, and confirming
          that the block extends the current best chain. The canonical chain is the one with the most cumulative
          proof-of-work.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>4. Difficulty Adjustment</h2>
<p>
          To keep the average block time near ten minutes, RTNC adjusts mining difficulty based on how quickly blocks
          are being found. If blocks are coming too fast, difficulty rises; if they are too slow, difficulty drops.
        </p>
<p>
          Difficulty adjustment is automatic and algorithmic. Neither miners, governance participants, nor the
          foundation can manually set or override difficulty.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>5. Emission Model</h2>
<p>
          RTNC has a fixed maximum supply of 10,000,000,000 RTNC. New coins are created only through block rewards, and
          those rewards follow a pre-defined schedule that decays smoothly over time rather than via abrupt halving
          events. This provides a more predictable environment for miners.
        </p>
<p>
          There are no mechanisms to pause, accelerate, or “re-mint” emission. Once the maximum supply is reached, no
          further coins are created.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>6. Mining Phases</h2>
<p>
          RTNC’s mining lifecycle can be understood as three overlapping phases:
        </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> CPU-focused early mining.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> GPU-dominant growth period.</li>
<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Potential ASIC-dominated long-term security.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6.1 CPU Phase</h3>
<p>
          At launch, the proof-of-work function and difficulty parameters are tuned so that CPU mining is viable. This
          phase is expected to last roughly eighteen months, though real-world mining behavior will determine the exact
          dynamics. The goal is broad distribution and low barrier to entry.
        </p>
<h3>6.2 GPU Phase</h3>
<p>
          As the network matures, GPU miners naturally gain dominance due to higher hash rates and efficiency. This
          phase improves chain security while still allowing smaller operations to participate if they choose to invest
          in consumer GPU hardware.
        </p>
<h3>6.3 ASIC Phase</h3>
<p>
          In the long term, dedicated ASIC hardware may be developed for RTNC. If this occurs, the chain benefits from
          the same kind of industrial-strength security seen in other large proof-of-work networks. The protocol does
          not artificially block this progression; it simply remains neutral.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>7. Hardware and Participation</h2>
<p>
          The protocol does not dictate what hardware miners should use, nor does it require them to purchase any
          particular device. Participation is voluntary and permissionless. Individuals and organizations can choose
          whether mining is economically sensible for them.
        </p>
<h3>7.1 CPU Mining</h3>
<p>
          During the early phase, miners can participate with multi-core CPUs and modest power usage. This phase favors
          technically inclined individuals rather than large capital pools.
        </p>
<h3>7.2 GPU Mining</h3>
<p>
          GPU mining introduces higher performance and power requirements, but still uses accessible consumer hardware.
          This phase is well-suited for hobbyists, small mining farms, and early infrastructure builders.
        </p>
<h3>7.3 ASIC Mining</h3>
<p>
          If ASICs emerge, they will likely be operated by more specialized mining entities. RTNC remains neutral: the
          protocol neither encourages nor discourages this; it simply maintains consistent rules while hashpower
          evolves.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>8. Miner Incentives and Limitations</h2>
<p>
          Miners are incentivized through block rewards and transaction fees. These are the only protocol-defined
          incentives. There are no extra bonuses, tax redistributions, or embedded reward multipliers in RTNC’s mining
          logic.
        </p>
<p>
          Miners do not receive governance rights by default, and owning mining hardware does not grant special
          authority over protocol rules.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>9. Network Security Considerations</h2>
<p>
          RTNC’s security comes from the cost of reorganizing the chain. As hashpower increases, it becomes more
          expensive to attack the network. The evolving phases (CPU → GPU → ASIC) are expected to increase total
          security over time as more hashpower joins.
        </p>
<p>
          The protocol does not include explicit penalties (such as slashing) because proof-of-work already imposes a
          natural economic cost on malicious actors: wasted electricity and hardware time.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>10. Legal Alignment</h2>
<p>
          RTNC mining is designed to remain compatible with non-security treatment. Miners are not promised returns,
          yield, or profit by the protocol or by the RTNC Foundation. They independently decide whether to mine, at
          their own cost and risk.
        </p>
<p>
          The mining process is competitive work, not an investment contract.
        </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>11. Long-Term Outlook</h2>
<p>
          Over time, RTNC aims to be a stable proof-of-work chain with clear rules, a transparent emission curve, and a
          mining ecosystem that grows or shrinks based on real-world economics rather than protocol gimmicks.
        </p>
<p>
          Mining exists to secure the network and distribute RTNC, not to operate as a financial product or yield
          mechanism.
